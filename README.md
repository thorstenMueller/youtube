# About this repo
Being an opensource voice technology enthusiast i like playing around with cool projects in this field of technology. I share my lessons-learned during this journey as step by step tutorials on my youtube channel "[Thorsten-Voice](https://www.youtube.com/@ThorstenMueller)".

Sometimes i create helper scripts and small code snipplets during my try'n error sessions and mention these scripts in my videos. This repository is meant to collect all of these scripts.

If you would like to support me, please subscribe to my "[Thorsten-Voice](https://youtube.com/c/thorstenMueller?sub_confirmation=1)" channel and share it with other open voice technology enthusiasts.

Thank you :)
